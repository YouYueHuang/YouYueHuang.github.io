A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places.

1. Check `anaconda` is installed and in your PATH
2. Open a terminal client.
3. Check if it is installed successfully with `conda -V`. If conda is installed you should see current Anaconda version.
4. Create a virtual environment for your projectÂ with `conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda`

In the terminal client enter `yourenvname`, which is the name you want to call your environment, and replace x.x with the Python version you wish to use. (You can see a list of available python versions with `conda search ^python$`.

This will install the Python version and all the associated anaconda packaged libraries at `path_to_your_anaconda_location/anaconda/envs/yourenvname`.
